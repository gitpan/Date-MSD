NAME

Date::MSD - conversion between flavours of Mars Sol Date

DESCRIPTION

For date and time calculations it is convenient to represent dates by
a simple linear count of days, rather than in a particular calendar.
This module performs conversions between different flavours of linear
count of Martian solar days ("sols").

Among Martian day count systems there are also some non-trivial
differences of concept.  There are systems that count only complete days,
and those that count fractional days also.  There are some that are fixed
to Airy Mean Time (time on the Martian prime meridian), and others that
are interpreted according to a timezone.  The functions of this module
appropriately handle the semantics of all the non-trivial conversions.

The day count systems supported by this module are Mars Sol Date,
Julian Sol, and Chronological Mars Solar Date, each in both integral
and fractional forms.
